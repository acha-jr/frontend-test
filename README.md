## **Challenges Faced and Solutions**  

### **1. Signature Positioning Issue**
**Issue:** After signing, the signature moved to a different position.  
**Solution:** Adjusted **canvas scaling** and **coordinate calculations** to maintain signature placement.  

### **2. Exporting PDF with Annotations**
**Issue:** Exported PDFs were missing annotations or had incorrect placements.  
**Solution:** Used `html2canvas` to capture document elements and `jsPDF` to ensure correct rendering.  

### **3. Maintaining Document Quality**
**Issue:** Exported PDFs had a loss of quality.  
**Solution:** Adjusted **canvas resolution** and **PDF compression settings** for clarity.
